    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 12, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      ApexView is a personal finance app designed to help you track accounts, net worth, income and expenses, and investment holdings.
      Your financial data is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <h3>1) Data you enter into the App</h3>
    <p>
      ApexView stores the information you enter (such as accounts, balances, holdings, and categories) locally on your device for the purpose of providing the App’s features.
      We do not require you to create an account.
    </p>

    <h3>2) Anonymous Diagnostics (optional)</h3>
    <p>
      ApexView can record technical diagnostics events to help identify bugs and reliability issues. These diagnostics are recorded locally on your device,
      not sent anywhere by default, and sent to our server only if you explicitly opt in and manually tap “Send report now”.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Email List (Mailchimp)</h2>
    <p>
      If you join the ApexView launch/updates email list on our website, we collect your email address to send launch updates and major product announcements.
      We do not sell your email address. You can unsubscribe at any time using the link in any email we send.
    </p>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>
      ApexView’s anonymous diagnostics are designed to avoid personal and financial data and do not include your name, email, balances, holdings, or transactions.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      ApexView may retrieve market data and currency conversion rates through backend services and third-party providers.
      Providers may process IP addresses or basic request metadata as part of normal internet operations. ApexView does not send your personal or financial data to those providers.
